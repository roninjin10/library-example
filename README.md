# lib-example

This is a basic example of calling a solidity lib function in javascript using [tevm](https://tevm.sh). Note tevm is not yet stable so reach out if you see anything odd.

## Requirements

Bun

```bash
npm i -g bun && bun upgrade
```

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## To run

```bash
bun run index.js
```

## How it generates bytecode

This repo uses the `tevm compiler` to generate bytecode. This happens automatically in [index.js](./index.js) via importing a solidity file.

The artifacts are in [.tevm/](./.tevm/) folder.

The configuration for bun is in [bunfig.toml](./bunfig.toml). This tells bun to compile solidity with tevm when it sees a contract import.

Tevm is perfectly usable without doing this via just using the abi and bytecode generated by other tools like foundry.

## How it runs solidity

The `memoryClient` is an in memory instance of the EVM (think anvil) and can execute arbitrary bytecode with the `client.script` method
